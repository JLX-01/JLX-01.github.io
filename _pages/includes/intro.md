Hi there!  I'm Xiaoxuan Li. I received my B.Eng degree in Automation at College of Electrical Engineering, [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/), China. Here you will learn more about me, my interests and  passion for research. You can find my CV here: [Xiaoxuan Li's Curriculum Vitae](../docs/CV.pdf) Thank you for visiting! 

My research involves big data (especially in medical image and electronic health records) using Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I am broadly interested in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence motivated by intelligent analysis and applications. Also, I am interested in human-computer interaction. I believe that interdisciplinary research approaches will continue to evolve and improve.
